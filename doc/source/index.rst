   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Reactive Planner
================
Currently, this project generates solutions to trajectory planning problems given in the `CommonRoad <https://commonroad.in.tum.de/>`__ scenario format.
The trajectories are generated according to the sampling-based approach in [1][2].



Getting Started
===============
These instructions should help you to install the trajectory planner and use it for development and testing purposes.

Requirements
------------
The software is  developed and tested on recent versions of Linux and OS X.

For the python installation, we suggest the usage of `Anaconda <http://www.anaconda.com/download/#download>`__.

For the development IDE we suggest `PyCharm <http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__.

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repository & create a new conda environment:

.. code-block:: python

   git clone git@gitlab.lrz.de:cps/reactive-planner.git
   conda create -n commonroad-py37 python=3.7

2. Install the package:

* Install the package via pip:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install .

* **Or** install the dependencies via the requirements file and add the root folder to the python path of your interpreter.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install -r requirements.txt


Example script
--------------

An example script `run_planner.py` is provided, which plans intended trajectories for motion planning
